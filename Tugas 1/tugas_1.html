            <p>
                Figuring out what to write on your own when you have no 
                clear idea is honestly the hardest part. I'm just hoping
                this still counts since the task is simply to make a 
                simple display with html and css. Also hoping that this 
                doesnt actually get read by those who understand 
                but alas, c'est la vie. Sincerely from me Rafi Rizani Ramadhan
